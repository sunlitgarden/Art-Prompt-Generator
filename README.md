# üé® Art-Prompt-Generator
This is a simple, free-to-use prompt generator for anyone who is bored and doesn't know what to draw. I hope that at some point, I'll be able to make this available for offline users. Please enjoy!
# 1. ü§ñ This generator was brought to you by Javascript
All input is either stored in strings or (in the case of pictures) directly input from either Coolor.com or blogs who create poses for free online. These blogs will, of course, be properly sourced and credited for curious users to explore at their leisure.

# 2. ‚úçÔ∏è The prompt 
The generator will provide you with the art style that you should draw in, a picture of a pose, a randomly generated color palette, and the subject you might want to draw. You can toggle on/off if you would like a prompt for a background or for a character.

You have multiple choice options for serious prompts, nostalgic prompts, calming prompts, comedic prompts, sexual prompts, or background-focused prompts.
# 3. ‚è∞ Other Features
After generating the prompt, you have the ability to set a timer for several options: 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, half an hour, 45 minutes, and an hour. This works well for people who want to get better at sketching poses very quickly. 
# 4. üñåÔ∏è Customizing the layout
Much like Ren'Py, you can lightly customize the layout of this application so that the display matches the mood of whatever you're trying to draw.
